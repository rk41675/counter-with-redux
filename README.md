Summary of the Steps:
1. Install packages: Install @reduxjs/toolkit and react-redux.
2. Create a Redux store: Create store.js using configureStore.
3. Create a slice: Define your state and reducers in counterSlice.js using createSlice.
4. Provide the store: Use the Provider component in main.jsx to pass the store to your app.
5. Use Redux: In your components, access the state using useSelector and dispatch actions using useDispatch.
